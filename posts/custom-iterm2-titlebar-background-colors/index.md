# Custom iTerm2 Titlebar Background Colors

If you are like me, you get pretty obsessed about the look and feel of your
development environment. Itâ€™s such a productivity waste, but I am a sucker for
nice looking apps. After all, as a dev, you look at this stuff all day.

Over the past years, Electron apps have become all the rage. If you look at a
typical JavaScript devâ€™s development environment these days, you will probably
notice them running either [Atom](https://atom.io) or
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSCode) for their editor
and [Hyper](https://hyper.is) for their terminal emulator. In particular VS Code
seems to have become the default editor for most. Personally, I do not really
like the look of VS Code. Yes, it has made a lot of progress and there are some
cool themes, but to me, it still really looks like a Microsoft product. At least
as soon as you start digging a level deeper. Atom and Hyper on the other hand,
not so much. Look at these two beautiful apps next to each other. They are
ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

Sadly, though, I cannot get myself to use these apps for work. I am used to
[Neovim](https://neovim.io)/Vim and Atomâ€™s model for splits is way too
different. It just does not feel right. And while Hyper is beautiful and its
plugin system rocks, as soon as I try to run Vim in it, I start noticing all
kinds of performance related glitches and lag. On top of all of that, these
Electron apps just take too much of my systemâ€™s resources. Today, I noticed Atom
causing 150% CPU load when I was scrolling its settings screen. _Scrolling_.
Both apps regularly take up gigabytes of memory.

So, I am stuck with my iTerm2, tmux, Neovim combo, which is not easy to get to
look really nice. With enough patience and determination, I think I ended up
with a nicely looking setup (getting theme colors to work has become a lot
easier thanks to [True Color](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) support
across the stack). You be the judge.

However, one thing that always bothered me was iTermâ€™s grey titlebar. In the
nightly builds, George Nachman has added support for macOSâ€™ dark mode for the
titlebar. This is nice, but still does not look as beautiful as Hyper.

Recently, I finally â€” by accident â€” found a solution to this problem. ðŸŽ‰ Turns
out, iTerm2 supports some
[proprietary escape codes](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html)
for overwriting certain settings. And yes, there are codes to change the
titlebar background color!

Here is how to set the titlebar color to the background of the
[iTerm2 One Dark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim/blob/master/term/One%20Dark.itermcolors)
theme I am using. Type the following into your iTerm2 terminal.

```bash
$ echo -e "\033]6;1;bg;red;brightness;40\a"
$ echo -e "\033]6;1;bg;green;brightness;44\a"
$ echo -e "\033]6;1;bg;blue;brightness;52\a"
```

This is what it looks like.

Finally. iTerm will not save this to your settings. The solution is to
automatically execute the above commands when launching a new session. Just add
them to your .bashrc or .zshrc, etc.
